# The problem Chirping solves

Chirping is a social media with a blend of gamification. In Web2 and Web3 both, social media dapps or apps are in control of a centralised authority and many a times it is seen that the central authority removes a post of a user without his/her concern. In today's social media you'll see many celebrities or rich users buy bots or followers even though they don't deserve, which makes the race of gaining followers or popularity dirty.
Chirping is a platform which treats every user equally in the beginning and as you get engaged and start posting valuable stuff on the platform which is liked by other users you gain abilities and features by getting promoted to a next level.

# Challenges I ran into

Chirping would've been better if it had its token to distribute to the users to gain utility and meaning in the crypto market. But since I am new to tokenomics and have to protect my dapp from various attacks, I did not involve any tokenomics into the dapp. The challenges I ran into were the developing of smart contract, defining levels, conditions and organising an interesting flow for the users.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
